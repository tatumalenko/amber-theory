# Amber Theory
> A Facebook chat bot for the BlockChain enthusiasts

## Inspiration
Potential for Cryptocurrency and BlockChain technologies is out there. Our goal was to make it easier for the average layman to want to use it. What is the best way to encourage mass adoption of decentralized concepts in a mainly centralized society? Through bridging both centralized and decentralized tools like Facebook (centralized personafied) and Ethererum BlockChain (decentralized personified).

## What it does
Facebook and Messenger are ubiquitous. Nearly everyone has had Facebook or will at some point. What better way to motivate the masses to learn and adopt decentralized technologies than to learn about them in the comfort of your centralized big brother Facebook.

## How we built it
Node, express, Facebook Messenger API.

## Challenges we ran into
How to incorporate BlockChain concepts into our chat bot app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We learned how to navigate the Facebook API.

## What's next for Amber Theory
Incorporate Ethereum Smart Contracts.
